Development of a Brain - Computer Interface (BCI) based on artificial intelligence algorithms to classify patterns of experiments using Steady State Visually Evoked Potentials (SSVEP) 

this project aims to design and implement a brain-computer interface with steady-state visual stimuli (SSVEP) for the control of the displacement of a device. 

For now, Python has been used for the development of both the experiment and the data processing. We are also looking to implement the system in real time ensuring high accuracy with low computational cost.
